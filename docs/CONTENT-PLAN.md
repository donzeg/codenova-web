## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Technical but Accessible**: Use technical terms but explain value in plain language
- **Confident but Not Arrogant**: "We excel at X" not "We're the best at X"
- **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what we **do** and what clients **get**
- **Specific Over Generic**: "NestJS with Prisma ORM" not "modern backend framework"

### Word Choice
**Use**: Build, engineer, architect, design, implement, deliver, optimize
**Avoid**: Synergize, leverage, utilize, revolutionary, game-changing

### Tone Examples
✅ "We build scalable web applications with modern frameworks like Nuxt 3 and NestJS"
❌ "We leverage cutting-edge technologies to synergize your digital transformation journey"

✅ "Our CI/CD pipelines ensure code quality and fast deployment cycles"
❌ "We revolutionize your DevOps workflow with industry-leading automation"
